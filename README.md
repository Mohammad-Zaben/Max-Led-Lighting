# Overview
- 
This Java program utilizes the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm to optimize LED lighting without wire intersections. It aims to maximize the number of lit LEDs while ensuring wires do not intersect. The user can input data randomly, manually, or from a file. The JavaFX-based user interface provides a graphical representation of the LEDs, wires, and the solution. Users can visualize and input LED and wire positions, enhancing the interactive experience. The program's flexibility in data input methods allows for diverse testing and usage scenarios, making it versatile for various applications.
